<h1>QSAR Editor - Descriptors Page</h1>



<p>
The Descriptors Page of the QSAR Editor allows for selecting the descriptors to be calculated for the molecules.

<p>

On the left side you can browse the available descriptors, or search by typing in the search box. 
If you only would like to see descriptors with an implementation available (and hence can be calculated), 
check the box "Display only with implementation" (checked by default). 
Select one or more descriptors and click the button ">>" to add them to the dataset.

<p>
In the top right canvas you can select provider for the descriptors in the combobox, which appears when you click on the provider. 
You can also remove the selected descriptor by selecting and clicking the button "<<" or the "delete" key on the keyboard. 
The lower right canvas allows for entering parameters for descriptors which are selected in the top right canvas.

<p>
The toolbar in the QSAR editor contains a shortcut icon in the top right corner 
to perform a complete build (calculate all selected descriptors for all selected molecules).
